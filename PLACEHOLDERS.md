# Placeholder Content to Replace Before Launch

## 🔴 CRITICAL - Must Replace

### RSVP Modal (`src/components/RSVPModal.tsx`)
- **Line 48**: `href="https://withjoy.com/[YOUR-URL-HANDLE]/rsvp"`
  - Replace with actual WithJoy URL
- **Line 57**: `Access Code: [YOUR_PASSWORD]`
  - Replace with actual password

### Favicon & Branding (`index.html`)
- **Line 5**: Replace `/vite.svg` with custom wedding favicon
- Add apple-touch-icon
- Add custom theme color

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

### Footer Component (`src/components/Footer.tsx`)
- **Entire component uses Thompson-Anderson content** - This file is not currently used in App.tsx, but if you want to add it:
  - Update names to Arora-Sood
  - Update email to correct address
  - Update RSVP date references

### Hero Component (`src/components/Hero.tsx`)
- **Entire component uses Thompson-Anderson content** - This file is not currently used in App.tsx, but if you want to add it:
  - Update names, dates, locations
  - Replace placeholder images

## 🟢 OPTIONAL - Already in Articles

All article content appears correct in `App.tsx` with Arora-Sood information. The articles are well-written and personalized.
